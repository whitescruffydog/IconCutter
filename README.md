# IconCutter
100x100px Icon Cutter<br/>
<br/>
Program originally designed for personal use to make Icons, and then shared with the community.<br/>
Please note that for this reason the code involved is not up to standard and is very messy.<br/>
<br/>
Features:<br/>
This is a very simple program that when launched will result in a black square following the pointer.  When the mouse button is clicked, the program will save what is on the screen within that square to the directory the program was launched from.<br/>
Pressing the a, b, c, or q keys will terminate the program.<br/>
Pressing the m key will minimize the program, effectively suspending operations.  Operation can be resumed by clicking on it, or similarly juggled by ALT / CMD + TABbing through active programs.<br/>
